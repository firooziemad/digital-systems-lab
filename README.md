# digital-systems-lab

This repository contains Verilog code for the lab assignments of the Digital Systems course. The designs were simulated using **ModelSim** software and implemented on the **Zynq-7000 SoC** board using **Xilinx Vivado**.

## Repository Structure
- **`common/`**: Contains shared files such as constraints, the top module, and reusable modules like the Hex-to-7-segment decoder.
- **`LabXX/`**: Each lab folder contains:
  - Verilog source files (`hdl/`)
  - Supporting documents

---

## Tools Used
- **ModelSim** for Verilog simulation.
- **Xilinx Vivado** for hardware implementation on the Zynq-7000 SoC board.
