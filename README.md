# Digital Systems Lab

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`common/`**: Shared resources (constraints file, top module, hex-to-7-segment decoder).
- **`LabX/`**: Each lab folder includes Verilog files and supporting documentation.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **ModelSim**: For Verilog simulation and functional verification.
- **Xilinx Vivado**: For synthesis, implementation, and programming on Zynq-7000 SoC.
- **Verilog**: Hardware description language for circuit design.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Developed Verilog-based digital circuits for various lab assignments. Designs were simulated in **ModelSim** and implemented on **Zynq-7000 SoC** using **Xilinx Vivado**.
